# Simple Data Fetch Example

This example shows how to fetch data from a remote server and perform an operation on it.

The `rigor-executor.py` file is only for local development and allows you to run a parallelised pipeline, simulating what would happen on the Rigor platform.

To run the example, make sure your terminal is in the root directory of the repo and run `python ./rigor-executor.py pokemon-fetcher`.
